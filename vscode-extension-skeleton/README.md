This folder contains a minimal VS Code extension that can be used to test the Swift grammar. To use it, open the repo root (the parent of this directory) in VS Code, and press <kbd>F5</kbd> to load the extension in a new window.

If you have the [`vscode-swift` extension](https://github.com/swift-server/vscode-swift) installed, you'll need to disable it so it doesn't override the scopes provided by the `.tmLanguage` grammar.

Learn more about VS Code extension debugging in [the documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension).
